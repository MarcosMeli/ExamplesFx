ExamplesFx
==========

DEPRECATED: It was mainly created for FileHelpers Examples https://www.filehelpers.net/examples/ but is hard to configure it for other uses, sorry

Allows super fast and great looking examples for any library, using compiled examples instead of plain text/html

That allows:

 * Compilable Examples
 * Avoid Typos
 * Auto-refactoring when changing library
